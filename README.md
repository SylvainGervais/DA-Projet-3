This project is a little game I realized because I'm trying to learn python development with openclassrooms.com.


In this game, you have to move your character (Mac Gyver) in a labyrinth for pick up items and go to the exit monitored by guardian (Murdoc).
In a first time, the game was created in console mode then a graphical mode was implemented.

For playing :

- create directory
- clone or download files
- create and activate python virtual environnement
- install dependencies from requirement.txt

Start game in console mode with : 
python3 main.py


Start game in graphical mode with :
python3 main.py -g
